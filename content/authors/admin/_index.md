I am a Research Scientist at [Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.inceptioniai.org/). I received my PhD in Image Processing (2013-2017) from the [University of Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/en/), Spain, under the supervision of [Prof. Marcelo Bertalmío](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ocxC_mYAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I completed my M.Sc. degree in Digital Signal Processing (2010-2012) from [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), and my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering (2006-2010) from [Comsats University](https://lahore.comsats.edu.pk/).
